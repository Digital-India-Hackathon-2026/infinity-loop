# Farmer2Gov 🌱
> **A Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI) web application streamlining pre-harvest crop registration, computer vision quality assessment, slot booking, and government procurement for farmers.**

Farmer2Gov bridges the gap between farmers and government agencies. It digitizes the procurement journey, starting from crop registration, automated quality verification via computer vision, slot booking coordinates, and direct benefit transfer (DBT) payments.

## 💻 Running the App in VS Code (Step-by-Step)

VS Code provides built-in terminal splits so you can run the backend and frontend side-by-side. 

### Terminal 1: Backend Setup
1. **Open VS Code** and open the `Farmer2Gov` folder.
2. Open a new terminal (`Ctrl + Shift + ~` or go to **Terminal -> New Terminal** in the top menu).
3. Navigate to the backend directory:
   ```powershell
   cd backend
   ```
4. Create a virtual environment:
   ```powershell
   python -m venv venv
   ```
5. Activate the virtual environment:
   * **Windows (PowerShell):**
     ```powershell
     .\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
     ```
     *(If you get a script execution policy error, run `Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass` in an Administrator PowerShell once, then activate again)*
   * **macOS/Linux:**
     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```
6. Install dependencies:
   ```powershell
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
7. Seed the database with sample farmers, officers, and admins:
   ```powershell
   python seed.py
   ```
8. Apply the SQLite database migrations:
   ```powershell
   python migrate.py
   ```
9. Start the FastAPI development server:
   ```powershell
   uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8000
   ```
   * *Backend API will run at http://localhost:8000*
   * *Swagger interactive docs will be available at http://localhost:8000/docs*

### Terminal 2: Frontend Setup
1. Open a **second terminal split** in VS Code (click the **Split Terminal** icon `\ \| /` in the top right of the terminal panel, or open a new terminal window).
2. Navigate to the frontend directory:
   ```powershell
   cd frontend
   ```
3. Install npm packages:
   ```powershell
   npm install
   ```
4. Run the frontend development server:
   ```powershell
   npm run dev
   ```
   * *Frontend React app will open at http://localhost:5173*

| **Farmer** | Any 10-digit number (e.g., `9812345678`, `9876543201`) | `123456` | Register crops, upload photos for AI analysis, book slots, publish marketplace listings, manage customer orders, and view sales charts. |
| **Customer** | `customer@farmer2gov.gov.in` (Password) or `9876543211` (OTP) | `customer123` or `123456` | Browse fresh farm produce, search by categories, apply coupons, add items to cart, checkout, complete simulated payments, download tax invoices, and track orders. |
| **Procurement Officer** | `officer_1@farmer2gov.gov.in` | `officer123` | Inspect crop samples, weigh grains, approve status, and print receipts. |
| **Administrator** | `admin@farmer2gov.gov.in` | `admin123` | View statistics, track state-level metrics, and view forecasts. |

## 💡 Demo Walkthrough Journeys

To experience the full capability of the application, follow these user journeys:

### 🌾 Journey 1: The Farmer Flow
1. Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173).
2. Choose your preferred language (English, తెలుగు, or हिंदी) on the welcome screen.
3. Log in by entering any 10-digit phone number (e.g., `9812345678`) and entering the OTP `123456`.
4. Go to **"Register New Crop"** and enter details (Crop Name, Quantity, Harvest Month).
5. Click **"AI Crop Quality Check"**: Take a photo or upload a crop sample. The computer vision backend estimates moisture, Impurities, and Uniformity.
6. Once analyzed, click **"Schedule Slot Booking"** to book a coordinate date and time at a nearby Procurement Center.

### 👮 Journey 2: The Procurement Officer Flow
1. Log out of the farmer account and log in using an officer's email (e.g., `officer_1@farmer2gov.gov.in`) and password `officer123`.
2. View the **Center Dashboard** showing upcoming scheduled farmer drop-offs.
3. Select a farmer registration, perform the **Weigh-in & Moisture check**, and mark it as **Approved**.
4. Generate the **Procurement Receipt** and click **Print** to see a print-formatted official receipt layout.

### 📊 Journey 3: The Admin Analytics Flow
1. Log out and log in as the Administrator with `admin@farmer2gov.gov.in` and password `admin123`.
2. Review the **Analytics Dashboard** showcasing crop distribution pie charts, state-wide registration metrics, and interactive timeline forecasts.

### 🏪 Journey 4: The Direct-to-Customer (D2C) Marketplace Flow

## 🌐 Deployment Steps (Beginner Friendly)

Here is how you can deploy the complete project to the web for free.

### 🗄️ 1. Deploy the Backend (FastAPI + SQLite Fallback)
The easiest way to deploy python APIs is via **Render** or **Railway**.

#### Deploying on Render (Free Tier):
1. Create a free account on [Render.com](https://render.com/).
2. Push your codebase to a **GitHub** repository.
3. On the Render Dashboard, click **New +** and select **Web Service**.
4. Connect your GitHub repository.
5. Configure the Web Service settings:
   * **Language:** `Python 3`
   * **Root Directory:** `backend`
   * **Build Command:** `pip install -r requirements.txt`
   * **Start Command:** `python seed.py && python migrate.py && uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT`
6. Click **Deploy**. Render will host your backend and provide a public URL (e.g. `https://farmer2gov-api.onrender.com`).

---

### 🎨 2. Deploy the Frontend (React + Vite)
The easiest way to deploy React static sites is via **Vercel** or **Netlify**.

#### Before deploying:
Make sure you update the backend URL in the frontend:
* Open `frontend/src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx` and change `const API_BASE_URL = 'http://localhost:8000';` to your live deployed backend URL (e.g. `https://farmer2gov-api.onrender.com`).
* Update the base URLs in [Login.tsx](file:///c:/Users/gasik/Desktop/Farmer2Gov/frontend/src/pages/Login.tsx), [Register.tsx](file:///c:/Users/gasik/Desktop/Farmer2Gov/frontend/src/pages/Register.tsx), and [RegisterCustomer.tsx](file:///c:/Users/gasik/Desktop/Farmer2Gov/frontend/src/pages/RegisterCustomer.tsx) if necessary, or let them dynamically consume config variables.

#### Deploying on Vercel:
1. Create a free account on [Vercel.com](https://vercel.com/).
2. Click **Add New** -> **Project** and import your GitHub repository.
3. Configure the settings:
   * **Framework Preset:** `Vite`
   * **Root Directory:** `frontend`
   * **Build Command:** `npm run build`
   * **Output Directory:** `dist`
4. Click **Deploy**. Vercel will build and serve your app.

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting & FAQ

* **Q: The backend fails with "ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'app'"**
  * **A:** Make sure you ran `python seed.py` and `python migrate.py` from inside the `backend` directory (not the root directory). Also, run `uvicorn app.main:app --reload` from inside `backend`.
* **Q: How does the SQLite fallback work?**
  * **A:** The system automatically checks if a PostgreSQL server is running via the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable. If not found, it creates and falls back to a local SQLite database file `backend/farmer2gov.db` without crashing.
* **Q: The crop analyzer says "Failed to analyze image".**
  * **A:** Make sure the upload directories are writable and OpenCV (`opencv-python-headless`) was successfully installed in your virtual environment.
